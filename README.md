# Determining optimal suitability in Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ)
## EDS223 - Homework #4 Leela Dixit

Repository containing all code and output for homework 4, in class EDS 223 of the MEDS program - Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing.
This project focuses on developing a workflow to determing habitat suitability based on sea surface temperature and depth for species of Oysters, and condensing that workflow into a reproducible function for Red Abalone.

# Data
Information on optimal sea surface temperature and depth for red abalone were collected from [Sea Life Base](https://www.sealifebase.ca/search.php). Sea surface temperature from 2008-2012 were originally generated through [NOAA's Coral Reef Watch daily 5km SST anomalies](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php). Depth of the ocean was characterized with [General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO](https://www.gebco.net/data-products/gridded-bathymetry-data#area). Maritime boundaries for exclusive economic zones (EEZ) were characterized by [marineregions.org](https://www.marineregions.org/eez.php).
